Your folder structure must stay as this (you can remove the warrington folder if you please however).

Requirements:
Tabix
Gzip
SnpEff/Sift in the directory galaxy-dist/tool-data/shared/jars/snpEff/
with the xml file located in galaxy-dist/tools/snpEff/
SnpEff will require you have previously downloaded the database you are needing to use.

command to download snpeff database example:
java -jar /galaxy-dist/tool-data/shared/jars/snpEff/snpEff.jar download GRCh37.64

Data file extract.py will need to be moved to tools/vcf_tools/ and overwrite the file.

# BUG DISCUSSION #

#SNPEFF#

Over the past week working with the software to do with genetics we have uncovered bugs and have sent emails to the
relevant developers of these projects.

Pablo Cingolani who is the solo developer of the project snpEff. This is a tool that is used to predict the effect of variants e.g Indels, SNP and MNPS. 

I have documented a bug within galaxy workflows which causes snpEff to crash when a certain option is not selected. 
Pablo and Our group came to the same solution although not elegant solves the problem as it is most definetely a galaxy issue.

Another issue with his software was to do with downloading the ensembl genomes using the download command line option. 
The software did not read the path specified in the config file and attempted to install the snpeffectpredictor bin file 
relative to where the program was run. This has been documented and through a email exchange with pablo and he say this 
will be fixed in the new release which is due to be live very soon.

#GALAXY#

Our group has joined the galaxy mailing list and has attempted to participate in discussions with the issues we are facing.

We cannot get the admin interface to work for certain users of our galaxy database we have followed all the instructions and nothing.

Also ftp does not work the files can be loaded onto the FTP server but cannot be viewed within galaxy.

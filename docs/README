Your folder structure must stay as this. And you must have dbSNP inside the galaxy/data folder.

mv extract.py ~/galaxy-dist/tools/vcf_tools/

Requirements:
Tabix
Gzip
SnpEff/Sift will need to be installed into the directory galaxy-dist/tool-data/shared/jars/snpEff/ and the xml file located in galaxy-dist/tools/snpEff/
SnpEff will require you have previously downloaded the database you are needing to use. We have placed these in the data folder. Simply move the databases into galaxy-dist/tool-data/shared/jars/snpEff/data folder.
dbSnp.vcf.gz and dbSnp.vcf.gz.tbi will need to be placed in /tools/SOER1000genes/data/ directory.

command to download snpeff database example:
java -jar /galaxy-dist/tool-data/shared/jars/snpEff/snpEff.jar download GRCh37.64

Data file extract.py will need to be moved to tools/vcf_tools/ and overwrite the file.
